        <h2>Locate with app</h2>
        <p>
          Use the app to find the nearest scooter to you. We are continuously
          placing scooters in the areas with most demand, so one should never be
          too far away.
        </p>
        <h2>Pick your scooter</h2>
        <p>
          We show the most important info for the scooters closest to you. So
          you know how much charge they have left and can see roughly how much
          it will cost.
        </p>
        <h2>Enjoy the ride</h2>
        <p>
          Scan the QR code and the bike will unlock. Retract the cable lock, put
          on a helmet, and you’re off! Always lock bikes away from walkways and
          accessibility ramps.

        <p>
          The Scoot app is available with riding telemetry. This means it can
          show you your average speed, how long you've been using the scooter,
          your traveling distance, and many more things all in an easy to use
          app.
